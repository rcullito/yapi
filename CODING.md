## Coding

### Design Goals

  * Use [golang](http://golang.org/)
  * Make it standalone.
  * Choose best community supported framework, lib, etc. if necessary.
  * Stay away from dependency for fundamental features.
  * Keep origin conventions of external libs for consistency.
  * Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
  * Do One Thing, and do it well (DOT)
  * Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
  * Don't Make It Complicated, for a little benefit. (DMIC)

### Code

  * For naming convention; camelCase capitalization used
  * For constants; UPPERCASE and `_` word separator used
  * For file naming; words separated by `-` instead of `_`
